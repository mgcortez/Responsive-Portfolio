<!-- Always start out with the <body> tag -->
<body>
  <!-- Here is the header and navigation bar -->
  <!-- First, we create a container for all the header elements. By holding them in a container we can style them more efficiently -->
  <!-- Although we created the header's container using <header id="masthead"> we could have also used <div id="masthead">. <header> is a newer tag and is just a little more specific. But <div> would have still worked. -->
  <header id="masthead">
    <!-- Next we have another container. This container style is written to be more general in its properties and therefore we can use it multiple times to help us achieve more efficient code and keep things more uniform -->
    <div class="container">
      <!-- Now that we've made our container structure for our header, we can have fun with content -->
      <!-- <a href=""> creates a link. We gave it an id so that way we can stylize it later without stylizing every single link in the project -->
      <a href="index.html" id="logo">Maria Gabriela Cortez</a>
      <!-- For our navigation bar we use <nav> as a container and put <a> links inside -->
      <nav>
        <!-- These links use relative paths. So the browser is going to look for those files relative to the file that is currently up. -->
        <a href="about.html">About</a>
        <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
      </nav><!-- nav -->
    </div><!-- .container -->
  </header><!-- #masthead -->

  <!-- Now that our header is done and contained nicely, let's make a container for the real star of the website - our content! -->
  <!-- The container <div> for our content has both an id AND a class. That means it is referencing the #main-container style in addition to .container style (which we used above in the header) -->
  <!-- By seperating the id and class, we can continue to apply the same, uniform properties with .container but also add styles specifically for this main container with #main-container -->
  <div id="main-container" class="container">
    <!-- Kinda like <header>, <section> is a newer HTML tag which helps with clarity. However, <div> could have been used too with the same result -->
    <!-- Now we create our first child section of the main-container -->
    <section class="main-section">
      <!-- Inside our first child section we can just insert our content and do our positioning and styling in CSS -->
      <h1>About me</h1>
